## English to French translation

You need to download the en-fr translation dataset (en-fr.csv) from Kaggle website into ```data/``` directory first.

Then you can directly run ```en_fr_dataloader.py``` to verify batch tensor generation.

Then, you can run ```en_fr_translation.py``` to train a model from scratch (needs hyperparameter tuning).
